Thank you for your interest in contributing skin images to the ISIC Archive.

The majority of current images have been provided by ISIC member institutions. We welcome and encourage members of the wider dermatology community contributing image datasets they recognize as having value for education and research purposes. While we require all contributors to agree to the [ISIC terms of use](#!/topWithHeader/tightDarkContentTop/termsOfUse) and provide a name and URL for themselves, a legal contact, and information about the source of the images, they will have the option of having their images attributed to them or exposed anonymously and the option to be listed or not listed among the formal *contributors*.

Each image set is associated with one specific institution known as a *contributor* and associated with a new or existing *cohort*. *Cohorts* are comprised of a set of images known as *accessions* and are related to a shared purpose with a common set of metadata points. The minimal metadata includes, but is not limited to, diagnosis (or malignant status), how the diagnosis was confirmed, approximate location on the body, and demographic features such as age and sex. Check out our [Archive infrastructure](#!/topWithHeader/tightContentTop/about/isicArchiveInfrastructure) and [data dictionary](#!/topWithHeader/tightContentTop/about/isicArchiveDataDictionary) pages for more information.
