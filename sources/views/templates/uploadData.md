Thank you for your interest in contributing skin images to the ISIC Archive.

The majority of current images have been provided by ISIC member institution. We welcome and encourage members of the wider dermatology community contributing datasets they recognize as having value for education and research purposes.

Each contribution is associated with one specific institution and associated with a new or existing cohort. Cohorts are comprised of a set of images known as accessions and are related to a shared purpose with a common set of metadata points. The minimal metadata includes, but is not limited to, diagnosis (or malignant status), how the diagnosis was confirmed, approximate location on the body, and demographic features such as age and sex. Check out our [Archive infrastructure](#!/topWithHeader/tightContentTop/about/isicArchiveInfrastructure) and [data dictionary](#!/topWithHeader/tightContentTop/about/isicArchiveDataDictionary) pages for more information.
