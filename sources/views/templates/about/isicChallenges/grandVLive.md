## Grand Challenges v. Live Challenges {.main-subtitle2}

In addition to hosting Grand Challenges with specific timelines and associated awards and workshops, ISIC has made its Challenge platform and datasets from the grand challenges available on an ongoing basis. These [‘Live Challenges’](https://challenge.isic-archive.com/landing/live) serve as a resource for researchers looking to benchmark the performance of their algorithms and for teachers and students in need of practice and testing opportunities.
