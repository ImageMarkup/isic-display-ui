## History of the Challenges {.main-subtitle2}

Beginning in 2016, ISIC has sponsored annual challenges for the computer science community in association with leading computer vision conferences. Over the years, the challenges have grown in scale, complexity, and participation. The earlier challenges were focused primarily on diagnostic accuracy for distinguishing melanoma from other benign and malignant skin lesions. By 2018, the diagnostic performance of the leading algorithms was consistently outperforming clinicians in ‘reader studies’. Additional challenges in 2019 and 2020 were designed to address the out-of-distribution problem and assess the impact of clinical context respectively. The 2020 challenge had 3,300 participants from around the world. In addition to the annual Grand Challenges, ISIC hosts ‘live challenges’ that allow researchers and students to benchmark the performance of their algorithms using ISIC images on an ongoing basis. 

The following table is a brief synopsis of the ISIC Grand Challenges. The individual challenge pages and associated leaderboards can be found at [https://challenge.isic-archive.com/](https://challenge.isic-archive.com/)
