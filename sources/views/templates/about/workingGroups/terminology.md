**Goals:** Considerable variability exists in the application of terms to describe the anatomic sites, diagnoses, and morphology (clinical, dermoscopic. and histologic) depicted in skin images. A lexicon of standardized terminology will facilitate teaching, content-based-image-retrieval, and consistent application of ground truth for training and implementing AI algorithms. The goal of the ISIC Terminology Working Group is to derive consensus lexicons that are consistent with broader medical ontologies based on input from the clinical and industry stakeholders, disseminate the consensus lexicons, and encourage adoption of same.  

**Accomplishments:** The Terminology Working Group has, through a series of Delphi projects and consensus meetings developed lexicons for neoplastic dermoscopic morphology, skin surface anatomy, and clinically relevant pathology diagnoses for cutaneous malignancy.  The dermoscopy consensus terminology has been published and is undergoing revision based on original research by the members of the Working Group which has quantified the interobserver reproducibility of the terminology in the the Expert Agreement Study on Dermoscopy of Melanocytic Lesions. The surface anatomy lexicon has been published and incorporated into the most recent edition of ICD (International Classification of Diseases) codes. The pathology lexicon has been completed and is undergoing peer review.

**Plans:** The Working Group is convening a follow-up consensus conference in collaboration with the International Dermoscopy Society to refine the lexicon for dermoscopy terminology based on the results of the Expert Agreement Study on Dermoscopy of Melanocytic Lesions. The anatomy project is working on defining the boundaries of each anatomic region with methods that can be applied to both 2D and 3D skin images
