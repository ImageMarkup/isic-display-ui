**Goals:**  Standard approaches to patient and lesion identification, documentation of lesion attributes, and image acquisition (e.g., poses, orientation, lighting, magnification, use of size and color calibration markers, etc.) are needed to ensure image quality, data integrity, and image comparability. Unlike other visual specialties (e.g., radiology), there are currently no agreed upon standards for techniques in dermatologic imaging. The goal of the ISIC Technique Working Group is to help derive consensus on such standards among stakeholders, disseminate a set of recommended standards, and encourage adoption of same. 

**Accomplishments:** Through a series of meetings and Delphi consensus projects, the Technique Working Group has developed and published on the current state of standards in dermatology imaging and a proposed set of standards with specific attention to patient poses, image orientation, and image quality.

**Plans:** The Technique Working Group has developed a public access instructional video for implementation of the consensus standards that have been developed. It is currently addressing channels for dissemination of the video and for encouraging stakeholders (e.g., dermatology imaging/software companies, electronic medical record companies, and the dermatology community) to adopt and implement these standards.
