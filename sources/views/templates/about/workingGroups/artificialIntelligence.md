**Goals:** The goal of the Artificial Intelligence Working Group is to promote the development of accurate and effective computerized systems to aid  melanoma diagnosis and clinical decision support by creating resources for and engaging the dermatology and computer science communities. The primary resource being created is a large and expanding open source public access archive of annotated skin images \([Goals of the Archive](#!/topWithHeader/tightContentTop/about/isicArchiveGoals)\). The Working Group is engaging the stakeholder communities through meetings, publications, conferences, and the hosting of artificial intelligence Grand Challenges and Live Challenges.  

**Accomplishments:** The Artificial Intelligence Working Group has been very successful in its goals. The specifics of the ISIC Archive, ISIC meetings, and ISIC Challenges are provided in other sections of the website \([Goals of the Archive](#!/topWithHeader/tightContentTop/about/isicArchiveGoals), [ISIC Working Group Meetings](#!/topWithHeader/tightContentTop/about/isicMeetingsGroups), [Goals of the Challenges](#!/topWithHeader/tightContentTop/about/isicChallengesGoals), [History of the Challenges](#!/topWithHeader/tightContentTop/about/isicChallengesHistory), [ISIC Publications](#!/topWithHeader/tightContentTop/about/isicPublications)\). The ISIC archive currently contains over 100,000 images. The five ISIC challenges have engaged thousands of participants and resulted in over 1,000 scientific publications. The ISIC workshops and conferences have achieved significant participation and recognition and have included the most prestigious and prominent computer science and dermatology conferences across the globe.

**Plans:** The Working Group continues to develop additional functionality in the Archive platform and to scale the size and complexity of the archive. One goal is to add clinical (standard photography) close-up images to the current collection of mostly dermoscopy images and increase the ethnic/racial and diagnosis diversity of the archive. We welcome additional contributors to use our contribution process ([Upload Data page](#!/topWithHeader/tightContentTop/uploadData), [Contact Information](#!/topWithHeader/tightContentTop/about/contactInfo)). There is an ongoing effort to crowd source the annotation of the images in the archive for dermoscopy attributes in partnership with the Education Working Group and with Centaur Labs. The working group plans to continue to support and host Grand Challenges and Live Challenges. Among the plans for future challenges, efforts are underway to assemble an annotated collection of images of lesions captured sequentially to permit inclusion of change over time as an additional diagnostic variable. Plans are also underway to explore multi-modality images (e.g., dermoscopy +/- clinical +/- RCM +/- histology). The working group also continues to engage the relevant communities with conferences and publications. Among these are an upcoming workshop at CVPR and organizing special issues on skin imaging for Elsevier's Medical Image Analysis (MIA) journal and the Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics.
