**Goals:**  Standards are needed to ensure adequacy and compatibility of dermatologic images as relates to resolution, processing (with special attention to color), technical metadata, compression, and encryption. The goal of the ISIC Technology Working Group is to help derive consensus on such standards among stakeholders, disseminate a set of recommended standards, and encourage adoption of same. The ubiquitous availability of off-the-shelf digital cameras and ‘smart’ phones has led to adoption of ‘mobile’ imaging by both patients and clinicians, introducing considerable technologic diversity. Attention to the diversity rapid evolution of digital imaging is needed in the development and dissemination of technology standards.

**Accomplishments:** In conjunction with the Technique Working Group, the Technology Working Group has used Delphi consensus to derive clinical parameters for the definition of adequate resolution for specific types of dermatologic images (e.g., overview v. close-up imaging). The working group has developed fiducial markers that are being explored as an aid to standardization. Another major focus of the Working Group has been on standardization of color across the full cycle of image acquisition, processing, storage, and review. To this end, a White Paper on color standardization has been developed and is under review.

**Plans:** The group is working toward publication of the color standards White Paper and continues to work closely with ISIC’s industry partners to prioritize and address additional technology standards.
