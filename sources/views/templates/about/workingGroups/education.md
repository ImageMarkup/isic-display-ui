## Education Working Group {.main-subtitle2}

**Members:** TBD

**Goals:** The images being amassed by ISIC are a rich resource for education and review of the images during the educational process poses an opportunity for ‘active learning’ to scale annotation of the archive. The goal of the working group is to create educational resources that use the archive, build a self-testing process that supports active learning, and help disseminate the standards derived by the other working groups. 

**Accomplishments:** In partnership with the International Dermoscopy Society, members of the working group have created *Dermoscopedia*; an award winning publicly available atlas of dermoscopy for the full spectrum of neoplastic and inflammatory dermatologic diagnoses. Dermoscopedia is a Wiki that includes clinical descriptions, dermoscopic findings, and example images for hundreds of dermatologic diagnoses. The platform includes *Dermoscopedia Academy* which guides users through a curriculum designed by expert consensus to cover the requisite core proficiencies in dermoscopy for dermatology trainees. 
 
**Plans:** The working group plans to enlist the Dermoscopedia community in the ongoing effort to scale the dermoscopy annotations in the Archive, which will increase its educational and AI value. A component of this effort is to gamify educational quizzes that support active learning and as a testing ground for approaches to AI interpretability. The working group will also play an important role in dissemination of the standards derived by the Terminology and Techniques Working Groups by incorporating these into the Dermoscopedia platform and the educational activities of the International Dermoscopy Society.
