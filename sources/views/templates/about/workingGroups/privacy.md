**Goals:** As in all other medical applications, frameworks are needed to ensure the appropriate use of dermatology with respect to patient confidentiality associated with dermatology images. The nudity associated with overview dermatology images adds an additional privacy concern. The goal of the ISIC Privacy Group is to develop a framework that provides guidance to clinicians and researchers on the appropriate use of dermatology imaging, and to promote dissemination of the same. The scope of the framework includes legal, regulatory, ethical, consumer expectations, consent, and technological safeguards.

**Accomplishments:**  The group has extensively researched the regulatory landscape regarding digital privacy in general, privacy in medicine in general, and how these relate to dermatologic imaging in particular. The regional variability in regulatory requirements make it very challenging to reach consensus on an international standard. As a starting point, the group has chosen to focus on the specific requirements in Australia and model their efforts on comparable medical domains.

**Plans:** The Working Group has mapped out a scope of work with milestones for a set of recommendations relevant to Australia with the intention of generalizing these to other regulatory environments. The group is actively seeking assistance in their efforts.
