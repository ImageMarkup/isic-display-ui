## Privacy Working Group {.main-subtitle2}

**Members:** TBD

**Goals:** As in all other medical applications, standards are needed to ensure the privacy of the personal health information associated with dermatology images. The nudity associated with overview dermatology images adds an additional privacy concern. The current lack of technology and technique standards for dermatologic imaging increase the risks of privacy breeches. The goal of the ISIC Privacy Group is to help derive consensus on such standards among stakeholders, disseminate a set of recommended standards, and encourage adoption of same.

**Accomplishments:**  The group has extensively researched the regulatory landscape regarding digital privacy in general, privacy in medicine in general, and how these relate to dermatologic imaging in particular. The regional variability in regulatory requirements make it very challenging to reach consensus on an international standard. As a starting point, the group has chosen to focus on the specific requirements in Australia and model their efforts on comparable medical domains.

**Plans:** The Working Group has mapped out a scope of work with milestones for a set of recommendations relevant to Australia with the intention of generalizing these to other regulatory environments. The group is actively seeking assistance in their efforts.
