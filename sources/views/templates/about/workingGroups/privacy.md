**Goals:** The aim of the privacy working group is to develop privacy frameworks that help ensure maintenance of confidentiality and appropriate consent for use and sharing of images and their associated metadata in dermatology imaging.  Dermatology imaging has unique privacy issues that are not addressed by existing health privacy frameworks. Namely, total body photography leaves the subject visually identifiable due the presence of their face, distinctive skin lesions or tattoos. These images are also sensitive images in that they contain nudity and show the patientâ€™s body habitus. Privacy frameworks that provide guidance to clinicians and researchers on the appropriate use dermatology imaging with respect to patient confidentiality are needed. These frameworks must comply with legal, regulatory, and ethical standards. Furthermore, they must meet societal and consumer expectations on how dermatology imaging is used.

**Accomplishments:**  The group has extensively researched the regulatory landscape regarding digital privacy in general, privacy in medicine in general, and how these relate to dermatologic imaging in particular. The regional variability in regulatory requirements make it very challenging to reach consensus on an international standard. As a starting point, the group has chosen to focus on the specific requirements in Australia and model their efforts on comparable medical domains.

**Plans:** The Working Group has mapped out a scope of work with milestones for a set of recommendations relevant to Australia with the intention of generalizing these to other regulatory environments. The group is actively seeking assistance in their efforts.
