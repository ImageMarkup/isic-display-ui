**Goals:**  The goal of the Metadata/DICOM Working Group is to promote the adoption of the internationally recognized DICOM standard for use in dermatology by developing consensus standards, disseminating these standards, and encouraging adoption. The DICOM dermatology working group will progressively develop supplements to the general DICOM standard for dermoscopy, total body photography, and reflectance confocal microscopy imaging. Further it will develop Structured Report objects to standardized results generation of melanoma screening, lesion tracking and the reporting of AI image classification. Standardized collection and representation of the data elements associated with an image positively impacts the usefulness and interoperability of the images. DICOM (Digital Communication in Medicine) standards are used across most medical specialties, but at the time of initiation of ISIC there was no active DICOM working group for dermatology. The goals of the Metadata/DICOM working group is derive consensus on such standards among stakeholders, develop DICOM standards for dermatology, and disseminate and encourage adoption of DICOM 
standards. 

**Accomplishments:** In 2019, under the leadership of the ISIC Metadata/DICOM Working group and in partnership with the International Dermoscopy Society activated a DICOM working group for dermatology. The group has since developed the Dermoscopy Supplement which was approved and published by DICOM Standards committee in November of 2020.

**Plans:** The group is working to promote the use the Dermoscopic Photography IOD and SOP class within the dermatology community through publications, social media, andour partner societies.  The group is working on a supplement for reflectance confocal microscopy and is laying the groundwork for standards for 3D skin imaging. The group is also contributing to a CP (Change Proposal) for DICOM handling of sensitive images.
