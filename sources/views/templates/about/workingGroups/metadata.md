**Goals:**  Data elements associated with or embedded in images relate to the subject of the image (e.g., demographics, diagnosis, morphology), technical details (e.g., capture device, settings, etc.) and technique details (e.g., poses, orientation, etc.). Standardized collection and representation of the data elements associated with an image impacts the usefulness and interoperability of the images. DICOM (Digital Communication in Medicine) standards are used across most medical specialties, but at the time of initiation of ISIC there was no active DICOM working group for dermatology. The goals of the Metadata/DICOM working group is derive consensus on such standards among stakeholders, activate a Dermatology DICOM working group and develop DICOM standards for dermatology, and disseminate and encourage adoption of DICOM standards. 

**Accomplishments:** The working group performed multiple surveys of the state of metadata standards in dermatology, published on the need for metadata standards, and advocated for the activation of a dermatology DICOM working group. In 2019, under the leadership of the ISIC Metadata/DICOM Working group and in partnership with the International Dermoscopy Society activated a DICOM working group. The scope of the DICOM working group is to develop supplements to the general DICOM standard for dermoscopy, total body photography, and reflectance confocal microscopy imaging and to develop Structured Report Objects for melanoma screening, lesion tracking and the reporting of AI image classification. The group has developed the Dermoscopy Supplement [WI 2019-04-C] which has completed public review and was approved at the in November of 2020.

**Plans:** The group is working to promote the use the Dermoscopic Photography IOD and SOP class within the dermatology community through publications, social media, andour partner societies.  The group is working on a supplement for reflectance confocal microscopy and is laying the groundwork for standards for 3D skin imaging. The group is also contributing to a CP (Change Proposal) for DICOM handling of sensitive images.
