## Organization of ISIC {.main-subtitle2}

ISIC is a collaboration between over 30 academic centers and companies from around the world. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center serves as the coordinating center for the project which is supported by research grants, philanthropy, and in-kind support from its members. The core ISIC team is comprised of clinicians, clinical researchers, engineers, and computer scientists from industry and academia. Several professional societies have partnered with ISIC, including the International Dermoscopy Society (IDS), the International Society for Digital Imaging of the Skin (ISDIS), and the Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine (SIIM). 

Individual facets of the project are addressed by Working Groups comprised of Key Opinion Leaders in the field and led by recognized experts. An oversight panel composed of the working group leaders serves to review and advise on the priorities, methods, and progress of the individual research teams and the collaboration as a whole.
