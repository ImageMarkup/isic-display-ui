## Content and Layout of the Archive {.main-subtitle2}

The ISIC Archive contains over 150,000 total images, of which approximately 70,000 have been made public. Images are associated with metadata describing additional attributes on an image level. Several of these attributes are what we call structured, meaning that images can be filtered and queried using faceted search in the [Image Gallery](#!/topWithHeader/onlyHeaderTop/gallery). 

**The current major publically available dataset are:**

When you open the [gallery](#!/topWithHeader/onlyHeaderTop/gallery), you will see on the left hand side of the grid view of images the search and various filtering mechanisms. By default, the search is applied to all indexed metadata fields. E.g. searching for "melanoma" will select (check) all filters in which melanoma appears. From there, you can refine the filters by either checking additional items (e.g. by including all unknown "melanoma class" items).

Each time the search/filter criteria are changed, the list of images being shown automatically updates to include all items fitting the criteria.

The following metadata fields are available for filtering:
*	benign vs. malignant (which also includes values "indeterminate" and "unknown")
*	diagnosis (e.g. "angioma", "dermatofibroma", "melanoma", "nevus", etc.)
*	approximate age (grouped into 10-year brackets)
*	sex
*	anatomic site (where the lesion is located on the body, 7 sub-categories)
*	clinical size (in mm)
*	type of diagnosis (how was the diagnosis confirmed?)
*	personal and family history of melanoma
*	other melanoma related items (class, mitotic index, thickness, ulceration)
*	dermoscopic and image type
*	tags and datasets with which images are associated

Whenever the currently displayed selection of images contains items you, the user, wish to group into a new selection, you can hover over any item and check the box displayed in the upper right corner. These items will be listed on the right hand side, and will become available for download (as a ZIP file, together with associated, published metadata). In the near future, we are hoping to add a feature to create arbitrary collections, which will also allow the user to generate DOIs, in case you wish to create a set of images with which a specific research study was conducted.
