## Goals of the Archive {.main-subtitle2}

The ISIC Archive is an open source platform with publicly available images of skin lesions under Creative Commons licenses. The images are associated with ground-truth diagnoses and other clinical metadata. Images can be queried using faceted search and downloaded individually or in batches. The initial focus of the archive has been on dermoscopy images of individual skin lesions, as these images are inherently standardized by the use of a specialized acquisition device and devoid of many of the privacy challenges associated with clinical images. To date, the images have been provided by specialized melanoma centers from around the world. The archive is designed to accept contributions from new sources under the [Terms of Use](#!/topWithHeader/tightDarkContentTop/termsOfUse) and welcomes new contributors. There are ongoing efforts to supplement the dermoscopy images in the archive with close-up clinical images and a broader representation of skin types. The images in the Archive are used to support educational efforts through linkage with Dermoscopedia and are used for Grand Challenges and Live Challenges to engage the computer science community for the development of diagnostic AI.
