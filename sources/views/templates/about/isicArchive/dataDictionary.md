## Data Dictionary for the Archive {.main-subtitle2}

Each image in the ISIC Archive may contain metadata which is attributed at the image-level as opposed to patient- or lesion- level. The minimal structured metadata includes, but is not limited to, diagnosis (or malignant status), how the diagnosis was confirmed, approximate location on the body, and demographic features such as age and sex. For more information about the specific structured metadata fields and their allowed values, please see our GitHub repository: [data dictionary](https://github.com/ImageMarkup/isic-archive/wiki/Image).
