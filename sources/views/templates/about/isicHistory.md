## Organization of the isic melanoma project {.main-subtitle2}

The research team assembled for the ISIC Melanoma Project draws upon the melanoma and imaging expertise of the international community of dermatologists interested
in standards development for skin imaging modalities. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center serves as the coordinating center for the project. Several professional
societies are engaged in this effort, including the International Dermoscopy Society (IDS) and the International Society for Digital Imaging of the Skin (ISDIS).
The IDS has prior experience in conducting successful, internet-based consensus studies.

Individual facets of the project are being addressed by Working Groups comprised of Key Opinion Leaders in the field and led by recognized experts.
A combined panel of the working group members serves to review and advise on the methods and progress of the individual research teams and the project as a whole.

The International Skin Imaging Collaboration: Melanoma Project is an academia and industry partnership designed to facilitate
the application of digital skin imaging to help reduce melanoma mortality. When recognized and treated in its earliest stages, melanoma is readily curable.
Digital images of skin lesions can be used to educate professionals and the public in melanoma recognition as well as directly aid in the diagnosis of melanoma
through teledermatology, clinical decision support, and automated diagnosis. Currently, a lack of standards for dermatologic imaging undermines the quality
and usefulness of skin lesion imaging. ISIC is developing proposed standards to address the technologies, techniques, and terminology used in skin imaging
with special attention to the issues of privacy and interoperability (i.e., the ability to share images across technology and clinical platforms).
In addition, ISIC is developing an open source public access archive of skin images to test and validate the proposed standards. The archive will also
serve as a public resource of images for teaching and for the development and testing of automated diagnostic systems.
