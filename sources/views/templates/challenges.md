### Thank you for your interest in the ISIC Challenges in image analysis! {.main-subtitle3}

For the past two years, we have organized the “ISIC: Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection“ grand challenges, presenting problems in lesion segmentation, detection of clinical diagnostic patterns, and lesion
classification, along with a high-quality human-validated training and test set of nearly 3000 CC-0-licensed images and metadata.

These challenges have attracted global participation, with hundreds of registrations dozens of finalized submissions (including a four page manuscript with each final submission), making them the largest standardized and comparative study in this field to date.

These challenges have yielded novel findings and numerous publications, and have been accepted as a de-facto reference standard in efforts by other research groups.
